## What is Babel?

* Like Webpack, Babel transpiles your Javascript code!
* It transforms higher level Javascript code into Javascript that the browser can understand.
* This is extremely useful for the various flavors of Javascript that are out there.
* Even with vanilla Javascript sometimes needs a little bit of help for older web browsers.
